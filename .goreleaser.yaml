    summary: CLI for managing and streaming data to Humio.

    # This the description of your snap. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
    # most important story about your snap. Keep it under 100 words though,
    # we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the snap
    # store.

      The Humio CLI is an easy way to manage your Humio cluster. You can also
      use it to tail files and stream them to Humio, but this is no replacement
      for a full-featured data shipper like filebeat.

    # A guardrail to prevent you from releasing a snap to all your users before
    # it is ready.
    # `devel` will let you release only to the `edge` and `beta` channels in the
    # store. `stable` will let you release also to the `candidate` and `stable`
    # channels. More info about channels here:
    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/channels
    grade: stable

    # Snaps can be setup to follow three different confinement policies:
    # `strict`, `devmode` and `classic`. A strict confinement where the snap
    # can only read and write in its own namespace is recommended. Extra
    # permissions for strict snaps can be declared as `plugs` for the app, which
    # are explained later. More info about confinement here:
    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/confinement
    confinement: strict

    # Each binary built by GoReleaser is an app inside the snap. In this section
    # you can declare extra details for those binaries. It is optional.
    apps:

      # The name of the app must be the same name as the binary built or the snapcraft name.
      humioctl:

        # If your app requires extra permissions to work outside of its default
        # confined space, declare them here.
        # You can read the documentation about the available plugs and the
        # things they allow:
        # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/interfaces.
        plugs: ["home", "network"]
