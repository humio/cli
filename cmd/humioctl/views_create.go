	connections := make(map[string]string)

		Short: "Create a view.",
		Long: `Creates a view with the provided arguments.

The "description" flag is a string, and the "connections" flag is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs
where the key is the repository name and the value being the filter applied to the queries in that repository.
If you want to query all events you can specify a wildcard as the filter.

Here's an example that updates a view named "important-view" to search all data in the two repositories,
namely "repo1" and "repo2":

  $ humioctl views update important-view --connection "repo1=*,repo2=*" --description "very important view"
`,
		Args: cobra.ExactArgs(1),
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			viewName := args[0]
			client := NewApiClient(cmd)

			if len(connections) == 0 {
				exitOnError(cmd, fmt.Errorf("you must specify at least view connection"), "Error creating view")
			}

			err := client.Views().Create(viewName, description, connections)
			exitOnError(cmd, err, "Error creating view")

			fmt.Fprintf(cmd.OutOrStdout(), "Successfully created view: %q\n", viewName)
		},

	cmd.Flags().StringToStringVar(&connections, "connection", connections, "Sets a repository connection with the chosen filter.")
	cmd.Flags().StringVar(&description, "description", description, "Sets an optional description")
